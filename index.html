                    Welcome! This site is my main landing page, but also a testbed for developing a skill I wouldn't otherwise work on, being web design.  
                    I would like to build everything from scratch, so this site will in an indefinite cycle of experimentation. 
                    Please excuse broken links and other instabilities as they come about.

                    I always find it a bit difficult to succinctly express my interests, since they are broad and volatile.  
                    Recently, my coursework has converged to mostly mathematical topics, like combinatorics and the theoretical computer science menu available at Princeton.  
                    My research interests lie broadly within learning, in both natural and artifical forms.
                    I did my undergraduate coursework at Whittier College, where I studied Biochemistry.            
                    <br><br>
                    My previous research experiences include some spent at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where I worked under Dr. Simon C. Jones developing a novel electrochemical method for converting CO2 to O2 on Mars.  
                    Additionally, I had a roughly two year affiliation with the Born Lab at Harvard Medical School working for Dr. Richard T. Born on a trial-by-trial analysis of a visual decision-making task using dynamic logistic regression.
